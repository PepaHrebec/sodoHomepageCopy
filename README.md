## Motivation

As with my other "copies" of various websites I found browsing the web, my motivation here was simply to practice. That and keeping my GitHub streak intact. Over the last few months I've been spending a lot of time on back-end, kinda neglecting basics of front-end. The website of **Å odÃ³** presented itself as a pretty regular small business website, giving me a reason to try to implement everything from pretty basic things such as sticky headers and responsive queries to an iframe of Google Maps. It was also the first time I've seriously used positions instead of Grid and Flex.
